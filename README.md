# red_raid_squeakquel
A python scraper that pull all of the headlines from the chinese language People's Daily

This builds off of the red_raid scraper that pulls the front page images.  If you are using this, remember to set your year/month/day/story parameters at the top in the variables at one below where you want to start, and to put the same values later on in the code.
